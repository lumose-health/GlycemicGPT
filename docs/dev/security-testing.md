# Security Testing

How security testing works in the GlycemicGPT CI pipeline, and how to extend it as the platform grows.

## Overview

Security testing has five pillars:

1. **SAST** (`security-scan.yml`, `security-full-suite.yml`) -- Semgrep static analysis on Python and TypeScript source code. Catches hardcoded secrets, injection patterns, and OWASP Top 10 at the code level.
2. **DAST & Auth Pentests** (`security-scan.yml`, `security-full-suite.yml`) -- behavior-based tests that spin up the Docker stack and attack it: auth flow penetration tests, IDOR prevention, SSRF blocking, OpenAPI-driven API fuzzing, nuclei vulnerability scanning, and OWASP ZAP active injection scanning.
3. **Dependency Vulnerability Scanning** (`dependency-scan.yml`) -- OSV-Scanner checks all lockfiles against the OSV database for known CVEs. Runs on every dependency change and weekly on a schedule.
4. **Static Analysis** (CodeRabbit) -- automated PR reviews that check for hardcoded secrets, medical safety violations, BLE protocol issues, and code quality. Configured in `.coderabbit.yaml`.
5. **Full Suite Pentests** (`security-full-suite.yml`) -- comprehensive security scan of the entire platform. Runs after merges to main or develop and by manual dispatch. Status badge in README.

### Medical Device Context

GlycemicGPT handles glucose data, insulin pump telemetry, and AI-driven diabetes insights. Security failures in this context can have health consequences. PRs targeting `main` must pass the Security Scan Gate before merging. Feature PRs targeting `develop` receive full suite coverage after merge.

## Two-Workflow Architecture

### PR-Scoped Smart Testing (`security-scan.yml`)

Runs on every PR targeting `main` and every push to `main` or `develop`. Uses **granular change detection** to only test what actually changed:

| Component | Paths Monitored | What Runs |
|-----------|----------------|-----------|
| API | `apps/api/**` | Semgrep Python, auth tests, IDOR, SSRF, fuzzer, nuclei API, ZAP API, ZAP Unauth API |
| Web | `apps/web/**` | Semgrep TypeScript, nuclei Web, ZAP Web baseline, ZAP Unauth Web |
| Sidecar | `sidecar/**` | Semgrep TypeScript |
| Infra | `docker-compose*.yml`, `**/Dockerfile*` | Everything (config changes affect all services) |
| Security | `scripts/security/**`, `.github/workflows/security-scan*` | Everything |

Key optimization: **mobile-only PRs skip the Docker stack entirely** (~2 min vs ~25 min). Feature PRs targeting `develop` do not run this workflow before merge. The targeted scan and full suite scan the resulting `develop` head after each merge.

### Full Suite Pentests (`security-full-suite.yml`)

Runs everything regardless of what changed. Triggered by:
- Push to main or develop
- Manual dispatch

The **concurrency group** (`cancel-in-progress: false`) prevents runner clobbering during rapid merges. At most 1 running + 1 queued run exist at any time. When multiple PRs merge quickly, the queued run tests the latest HEAD (which includes all merged changes). Every merge is eventually covered.

## CI Security Gates

Checks 1-7 run unconditionally on every push/PR from `ci.yml`. Checks 8-9 use a gate job pattern that conditionally skips the heavy work when the PR doesn't touch relevant paths, while still reporting a green check so branch protection is satisfied.

| # | Required Check | Workflow | Triggers On |
|---|----------------|----------|-------------|
| 1 | Backend Tests | `ci.yml` | Every push/PR |
| 2 | Backend Lint | `ci.yml` | Every push/PR |
| 3 | Frontend Tests | `ci.yml` | Every push/PR |
| 4 | Frontend Lint | `ci.yml` | Every push/PR |
| 5 | Attribution Check | `ci.yml` | Every push/PR |
| 6 | Sidecar Tests | `ci.yml` | Every push/PR |
| 7 | GitGuardian | External | Every push/PR |
| 8 | Security Scan Gate | `security-scan.yml` | PRs targeting `main`; component-specific (see table above) |
| 9 | Dependency Scan Gate | `dependency-scan.yml` | Dependency file changes + weekly schedule |

Additionally, the **Security Full Suite** badge on the README reflects the pass/fail status of comprehensive pentests on main.

### Gate Job Pattern (Checks 8-9)

```text
detect-changes  -->  sast (if code changed)     -->  gate (always)
                -->  dast (if Docker needed)     -->
```

- **detect-changes**: Uses `dorny/paths-filter@v3` with 6 granular component filters. Computes derived flags (`needs_sast`, `needs_docker`, `run_all`).
- **sast**: Runs Semgrep on changed components. No Docker stack needed. Runs in parallel with DAST.
- **dast**: Builds Docker stack and runs targeted DAST tests based on which components changed.
- **gate**: Runs `if: always()`. Evaluates both SAST and DAST results. Posts unified PR comment via glycemicgpt-security.

## SAST (Static Analysis Security Testing)

**Tool:** [Semgrep](https://semgrep.dev/) with language-specific rulesets.

| Language | Rulesets | Scanned Paths |
|----------|----------|---------------|
| Python | `p/python`, `p/owasp-top-ten`, `p/secrets` | `apps/api/`, `scripts/security/` |
| TypeScript | `p/typescript`, `p/owasp-top-ten`, `p/secrets` | `apps/web/`, `sidecar/` |

In the full suite workflow, SARIF results are uploaded to the GitHub Security tab for centralized vulnerability tracking.

## DAST & Auth Penetration Tests

### Test Suites

1. **Auth flow tests** (`test-auth-flows.py`) -- 15 behavior-based tests covering registration, login, token handling, RBAC, and logout.
2. **Data isolation tests** (`test-data-isolation.py`) -- OpenAPI-driven. Auto-discovers ALL endpoints. Tests unauthenticated access (401), CSRF enforcement (403), and cross-user data isolation (IDOR).
3. **Research security tests** (`test-research-security.py`) -- SSRF prevention, rate limiting, source limits, input validation, CSRF enforcement on research endpoints.
4. **API fuzzer** (`fuzz-api.py`) -- OpenAPI-driven. Runs two passes: authenticated (with session) and unauthenticated (attacker perspective). Sends SQL injection, XSS, path traversal, type confusion, and oversized payloads to all discovered endpoints. Asserts no 500 errors in either pass.
5. **Nuclei DAST** -- Known vulnerability templates against API and Web surfaces.
6. **ZAP API active scan** (`zap-api-plan.yaml`) -- Authenticated, OpenAPI-driven injection testing (SQLi, XSS, SSTI, CRLF, path traversal). Auto-discovers all endpoints.
7. **ZAP Web scan** (`zap-web-plan.yaml`) -- Pre-seeds all known page URLs + standard spider + passive/active scanning on the web frontend. Tests security headers, cookie flags, CSP, and injection through the proxy path.
8. **ZAP Unauthenticated API pentest** (`zap-unauth-api-plan.yaml`) -- Full attacker-perspective scan of the **entire API surface** without credentials. Discovers all endpoints from `/openapi.json` and probes every one -- public and authenticated alike. Tests injection, info disclosure in error responses, security headers, Host header injection, and what leaks when authenticated endpoints return 401/403. Runs on every PR targeting `main` regardless of which component changed.
9. **ZAP Unauthenticated Web pentest** (`zap-unauth-web-plan.yaml`) -- Full attacker-perspective scan of the **entire web application** without credentials. Probes all pages including protected `/dashboard/*` routes to test redirect behavior, auth enforcement, and info leakage. Includes error handling probes (invalid invitation tokens, nonexistent pages). Runs on every PR targeting `main` regardless of which component changed.

### Auto-discovery

Tests 2, 4, 6, and 8 read `/openapi.json` from the live API to discover endpoints. **New API routes are automatically tested without any test code changes.**

Test 7 pre-seeds all known page URLs from the Next.js app structure and uses the standard spider to discover additional linked pages. (AJAX Spider with headless Firefox was evaluated but risks OOM on standard GitHub runners with 7GB RAM.)

Tests 8 and 9 simulate a real external attacker. They run without session cookies or CSRF tokens, probe the **entire** application surface (not just public endpoints), and run on **every PR** regardless of which component changed. An attacker doesn't care which files you modified -- they probe everything. Protected endpoints are intentionally tested to verify auth enforcement and catch info leakage in error responses. Findings are tracked as separate issues from the authenticated scans (distinct fingerprints: `zap-unauth-api:*` and `zap-unauth-web:*`).

### Evaluation scripts

Results are evaluated by standalone Python scripts (not inline shell):
- `scripts/security/evaluate-sast.py` -- reads Semgrep JSON per language, counts ERROR-severity findings, handles scanner crashes and corrupt JSON
- `scripts/security/evaluate-zap.py` -- reads ZAP traditional-json reports, counts Medium+ alerts, supports suppressions

### ZAP authentication

The authenticated ZAP plans (`zap-api-plan.yaml`, `zap-web-plan.yaml`) use `${ZAP_SESSION}` and `${ZAP_CSRF}` placeholders. ZAP's Automation Framework does **not** expand environment variables, so CI uses `envsubst` to bake actual cookie values into resolved copies before passing them to ZAP. The resolved files (`*.resolved.yaml`) are gitignored and exist only during the CI run.

The unauthenticated ZAP plans (`zap-unauth-api-plan.yaml`, `zap-unauth-web-plan.yaml`) have no placeholders and are used directly (no `envsubst` needed). They omit the `replacer` and `script` jobs, so ZAP sends no session cookies.

### Suppressions

Two suppression mechanisms exist:

| File | Tool | Format |
|------|------|--------|
| `osv-scanner.toml` | OSV-Scanner | TOML `[[IgnoredVulns]]` with `id` and `reason` |
| `scripts/security/zap-suppressions.json` | ZAP evaluator | JSON with `pluginId`, `scan`, and `reason` |

Every suppression **must** include a reason and should reference the issue that will fix the underlying problem (e.g., `Fix tracked in #123`). Suppressed findings are still logged in CI output (visible, not hidden) but don't fail the build. Review suppressions quarterly.

### Test results

Scan results are uploaded as GitHub Actions artifacts with 30-day retention:
- `sast-results` -- Semgrep JSON output
- `dast-results` -- ZAP reports, nuclei JSON, custom test output

### Issue automation

Security findings are automatically tracked as GitHub Issues via glycemicgpt-security. The full lifecycle:

| Event | What happens |
|-------|-------------|
| PR scan finds a vulnerability | Issue created, assigned to PR author, tagged with PR number |
| Contributor pushes a fix | Next scan auto-closes the issue ("resolved in PR #X") |
| PR merged, finding still present | Full suite keeps the issue open |
| PR merged, finding resolved | Full suite auto-closes the issue |
| Feature PR closed without merging | Cleanup job closes issues tagged with that PR |
| Promotion PR closed without merging | Cleanup skipped (findings originate from develop, not the promotion branch) |
| Finding reappears after fix reverted | Full suite reopens the closed issue |
| Full suite runs, finding still present | "Still detected" comment added (throttled to once per 7 days) |

**Tool-aware guards:** Auto-close only applies to findings from tools that actually produced results in the current run. If SAST crashes but DAST succeeds, only DAST-sourced issues are eligible for closure.

**Deduplication:** Each finding gets a deterministic fingerprint stored as an HTML comment in the issue body. Before creating, the script checks all existing automated issues to prevent duplicates.

**Suppressed findings** still get issues created, but labeled `accepted-risk` with the suppression reason. This creates a paper trail -- every known risk has a visible issue.

**Script:** `scripts/security/create-finding-issues.py` -- runs in the gate/summary job of both workflows. Supports `--dry-run` for local testing.

## Dependency Vulnerability Scanning

**Workflow:** `.github/workflows/dependency-scan.yml`
**Triggers:** Dependency file changes + weekly Monday 6am UTC schedule + manual dispatch.

### Covered manifests

| Ecosystem | Lockfile | Auto-updated by |
|-----------|----------|-----------------|
| Python (API) | `apps/api/uv.lock` | Renovate |
| Node.js (Web) | `apps/web/package-lock.json` | Renovate |
| Node.js (Sidecar) | `sidecar/package-lock.json` | Renovate |
| Python (Security) | `scripts/security/requirements.txt` | Manual |
| JVM (Medtronic spike) | `tools/medtronic-ble-spike/gradle.lockfile` | `regen-gradle-lockfiles.yml` on Renovate PRs |

The scanner uses [Google OSV-Scanner](https://google.github.io/osv-scanner/) with explicit lockfile paths for Python/Node plus a recursive sweep that picks up `gradle.lockfile` files.

Gradle coverage comes from [dependency locking](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/dependency_locking.html):
the standalone Medtronic spike commits a `gradle.lockfile` that OSV-Scanner reads (it does not
parse `build.gradle.kts` or `libs.versions.toml`). Renovate itself runs in a container without
the Android SDK and cannot regenerate Gradle lockfiles, so the `regen-gradle-lockfiles.yml`
workflow refreshes it on Renovate's Gradle PRs and pushes the result back to the PR branch.
After a manual dependency change, regenerate with `./gradlew dependencies --write-locks`.

(The Android app, Wear OS companion, and watchface -- and their own Gradle dependency locking
-- now live in [`lumose-health/android-unofficial`](https://github.com/lumose-health/android-unofficial); see [that repo's security testing doc](https://github.com/lumose-health/android-unofficial/blob/main/docs/dev/security-testing.md) for their coverage.)

### Handling findings

| Severity | Action | Timeline |
|----------|--------|----------|
| Critical / High | Block merge, fix immediately | Same PR or hotfix |
| Medium | Create issue, fix in current sprint | 1-2 weeks |
| Low | Triage -- fix if easy, suppress if not exploitable | Best effort |

### Suppressing false positives

Add entries to `osv-scanner.toml` in the repo root:

```toml
[[IgnoredVulns]]
id = "GHSA-xxxx-yyyy-zzzz"
reason = "Not exploitable -- only affects feature X which we don't use"
```

Every suppression must include a reason. Review suppressions quarterly.

## Dependency Auto-Merge Coverage

This section is the contract that governs which Renovate dependency updates are eligible for automated merge. A dependency category is auto-merge eligible only when this table proves the relevant security tests fire when that category changes, and the relevant required status checks are wired to fail-block the merge if a regression slips in.

If a category is missing from the table, or any of its rows is marked as a gap, that category stays manual until the gap is closed. **Default-deny**: any dependency category not explicitly classified here as auto-merge-eligible stays manual.

This contract governs Renovate only. Dependabot is not enabled in this repository (no `.github/dependabot.yml`).

### Threat model

Coverage is scoped to what an end-user deploying GlycemicGPT exposes to the internet. The deploy examples (`deploy/examples/cloudflare-tunnel/`, `prod-caddy/`, `public-cloud/`, `external-redis/`) reverse-proxy only the web service. The API is reachable through Next.js rewrites on the docker network.

**The AI sidecar is internal-only.** No `ports:` mapping in any deploy example, no Caddyfile / cloudflared upstream points at it. The sidecar row's "no DAST required" verdict depends on this; if a future deploy example exposes the sidecar, re-evaluate that row.

The API-to-sidecar boundary is enforced by a shared bearer token (`SIDECAR_API_KEY`, see `sidecar/src/server.ts`). SSRF tests in `scripts/security/test-research-security.py` block outbound requests to RFC1918 addresses, which includes the docker-network address where the sidecar lives.

GlycemicGPT also does not run AI models. The `apps/api` Python SDKs (`anthropic`, `openai`) and the sidecar's CLI subprocesses are HTTP/process bridges to models that the user hosts (subscription, BYOAI key, or local LLM). Prompt-injection or jailbreak testing of our code is out of scope -- there is no model in our containers to attack. Bridge-layer concerns (key handling, IDOR on AI endpoints, malformed-input crashes) are covered by the existing IDOR / secrets / fuzz suites.

### Defense-in-depth controls outside the test surface

Several controls complement the in-CI tests and are part of why patch+minor auto-merge is acceptable:

- **`minimumReleaseAge: "3 days"`** in `.github/renovate.json5` -- newly published versions wait 3 days before Renovate creates a PR. This is the primary defense against compromised-publish events of the kind that hit `event-stream`, `colors.js`, and `chalk`/`debug`. Vulnerability-flagged updates skip the soak window automatically (Renovate also auto-bypasses `prHourlyLimit`, `prConcurrentLimit`, and `schedule` for security alerts by design).
- **`internalChecksFilter: "strict"`** in `.github/renovate.json5` -- Renovate refuses to surface updates that fail its own pre-PR sanity checks (e.g., missing changelog metadata, parse failures).
- **File-scope guard in `.github/workflows/auto-merge-renovate.yml`** -- before any auto-merge call, the workflow verifies the PR only touches files in a hardcoded allowlist (lockfiles, manifests, Dockerfiles, workflow `uses:` pins, Renovate's own config). A Renovate PR that touches anything outside that list -- source code, CODEOWNERS, README, etc. -- is rejected and falls through to human review.

This contract assumes the Renovate App is uncompromised. The App's repository permissions are the upper bound on what Renovate can do; review them when permissions change.

### Coverage table

Read this as: "if a Renovate PR changes a dependency in the **Dep Category** column, the **Tests That Fire** column is what runs and must pass before merge."

| Dep Category | Manager / Manifest | Trigger Path Filter | Tests That Fire | Auto-Merge Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Python crypto / JWT (`python-jose[cryptography]`, `bcrypt`) | uv / `apps/api/uv.lock` | `apps/api/**` -> api=true | Semgrep `p/python` + `p/secrets`; auth pentests (`test-auth-flows.py`: wrong-key, alg-confusion, expired-token, timing enum); OSV-Scanner | SAFE (patch+minor) |
| Python web framework (`fastapi`, `starlette`, `pydantic`, `uvicorn`, `python-multipart`, `slowapi`) | uv / `apps/api/uv.lock` | `apps/api/**` | Semgrep; full DAST (CSRF, CORS, cookie flags, rate-limit XFF bypass `test-auth-flows.py`); IDOR (`test-data-isolation.py`); fuzzer (SQLi/XSS/path-traversal/JSON-shaped oversized/type-confusion, both auth & unauth -- multipart-specific oversized payloads are not asserted); ZAP API + Unauth API; nuclei API; OSV | SAFE (patch+minor) |
| Python ORM/DB (`sqlalchemy`, `alembic`, `asyncpg`, `redis`, `pgvector`) | uv / `apps/api/uv.lock` | `apps/api/**` | Semgrep `p/python` SQLi rules; fuzzer SQLi payloads; ZAP API SQLi active scan; IDOR cross-user reads; OSV | SAFE (patch+minor) |
| Python HTTP clients (`httpx`, `beautifulsoup4`) | uv / `apps/api/uv.lock` | `apps/api/**` | `test-research-security.py` SSRF (localhost, RFC1918 -- which includes the docker network where the sidecar lives, IMDS 169.254.169.254, IPv6 loopback, GCP metadata hostname `metadata.google.internal`); OSV | SAFE (patch+minor) |
| Python AI SDKs (`anthropic`, `openai`) | uv / `apps/api/uv.lock` | `apps/api/**` | Semgrep `p/secrets` (key leakage); fuzzer hits `/api/ai/*`; IDOR on AI endpoints; OSV. AI SDKs are HTTP clients to user-chosen LLMs -- prompt-injection testing is not applicable (see Threat model above). | SAFE (patch+minor) |
| Python data-source SDKs (`pydexcom`, `tconnectsync`, `apscheduler`, `fastembed`) | uv / `apps/api/uv.lock` | `apps/api/**` | Semgrep; OSV; fuzzer if they expose endpoints | SAFE (patch+minor) |
| Python parsing (`pillow`, `lxml`, `pyyaml`) | uv / `apps/api/uv.lock` | `apps/api/**` | `fuzz-api.py` type-confusion + oversized payloads; OSV | SAFE (patch+minor) |
| Web framework (`next`, `react`, `react-dom`) | npm / `apps/web/package-lock.json` | `apps/web/**` -> web=true | Semgrep `p/typescript` + `p/owasp-top-ten`; ZAP Web baseline + Unauth Web (CSP, headers, redirect leakage); nuclei Web; OSV | SAFE (patch+minor) |
| Web UI (`@tanstack/react-query`, `framer-motion`, `lucide-react`, `recharts`, `tailwind-merge`, `clsx`, `class-variance-authority`) | npm / `apps/web/package-lock.json` | `apps/web/**` | Semgrep TS; ZAP Web passive; OSV | SAFE (patch+minor) |
| Web markdown renderers (`react-markdown`, `remark-gfm`) | npm / `apps/web/package-lock.json` | `apps/web/**` | Semgrep TS XSS rules; ZAP Web XSS active scan; OSV | SAFE (patch); manual on minor |
| Web build/dev (`eslint*`, `jest`, `@testing-library/*`, `postcss`, `tailwindcss`, `autoprefixer`, `typescript`, `@types/*`) | npm / `apps/web/package-lock.json` | `apps/web/**` (devDep) | Same as web framework. devDeps don't ship to runtime. | SAFE (patch+minor) |
| Sidecar runtime (`express`) | npm / `sidecar/package-lock.json` | `sidecar/**` -> sidecar=true | Semgrep TS; OSV. Sidecar is internal-only (see Threat model); no internet exposure means no DAST is required at the sidecar boundary. AI traffic transits via API endpoints which are DAST-covered. | SAFE (patch+minor) |
| Sidecar build/test (`tsx`, `typescript`, `vitest`, `@types/*`) | npm / `sidecar/package-lock.json` | `sidecar/**` (devDep) | Semgrep TS; OSV | SAFE (patch+minor) |
| Docker base images (`python`, `node`, `alpine`) | docker / Dockerfiles | `**/Dockerfile*` -> infra=true -> `run_all=true` | Everything: full SAST + full DAST (auth, IDOR, fuzzer, ZAP, nuclei, both unauth scans); OSV | SAFE (digest + patch) |
| Docker service images (`pgvector/pgvector`, `redis`) | docker / docker-compose / Dockerfiles | `**/Dockerfile*` or `docker-compose*.yml` -> infra=true -> `run_all=true` | Everything: full SAST + full DAST; OSV | SAFE (digest + patch) |
| docker-compose / infra config | docker-compose / `docker-compose*.yml` | `docker-compose*.yml` -> infra=true | Same as above (run_all) | SAFE (digest + patch) |
| GitHub Actions (`actions/checkout`, `dorny/paths-filter`, `docker/*`, etc.) | github-actions / `.github/workflows/*.yml` | See **GitHub Actions Supply-Chain Hygiene** below | SHA-pin freezes audited code; `zizmor` static analysis (advisory mode today); Renovate vulnerability alerts cover known-compromised actions | SAFE (patch+minor) once `Workflow Lint Gate` is tightened from advisory to required status check (tracked in #542). Until then: manual. |
| Vendored Swagger / Redoc (SHA-pinned in `apps/api/Dockerfile`) | regex / Dockerfile | `**/Dockerfile*` -> infra=true -> run_all | Full DAST + ZAP Web (catches CSP/XSS regressions in served Swagger HTML) | SAFE (patch). Renovate already requires hash refresh in same PR. |
| Kustomize / K8s manifests (`k8s/base/*.yaml`) | n/a -- not Renovate-managed | n/a | n/a | Always manual |
| `scripts/security/requirements.txt` (security tooling itself) | manual -- not Renovate | `scripts/security/**` or `.github/workflows/security-scan*` -> security=true -> run_all | Full SAST + DAST + OSV | n/a (manual) |

### GitHub Actions Supply-Chain Hygiene

GitHub Actions are pinned by string (`uses: actions/checkout@v4`) and those strings reference mutable tags. A maintainer (or anyone who compromises a maintainer's account) can re-point a tag to a different commit; the next workflow run executes whatever code the tag now points to. The `tj-actions/changed-files` and `reviewdog` 2025 incidents are well-known examples of this attack class.

Two controls protect against this. Both must be operational before GitHub Actions enter the auto-merge tier.

1. **SHA-pin every action.** All actions in `.github/workflows/**` are pinned by commit SHA (e.g., `uses: dorny/paths-filter@d1c1ffe0248fe513906c8e24db8ea791d46f8590 # v3.0.3`). The `helpers:pinGitHubActionDigests` Renovate preset is enabled in `.github/renovate.json5` so SHAs stay current automatically while preserving the trailing `# vX.Y.Z` comment for human readability. **Status: landed.** Third-party SHAs in PR #541; first-party `actions/*` SHAs in PR #543 (Renovate's automated conversion).
2. **`zizmor` workflow static analysis.** `.github/workflows/workflow-lint.yml` runs zizmor on PRs that touch `.github/workflows/**` and catches command-injection-via-input, excessive `permissions:` grants, dangerous `pull_request_target` patterns, cache poisoning, missing `persist-credentials: false`, and unpinned action references. **Status: landed in PR #541 in advisory mode** (does not fail builds; surfaces findings as run-log output and downloadable SARIF). Tightening to a required status check, with findings flowing through `create-finding-issues.py` like SAST/DAST findings do today, is tracked in #542.

A third control was originally planned -- OSV-Scanner over workflow files -- but was withdrawn after verifying that OSV-Scanner v2.3.3 has no GitHub Actions extractor (the path filter would have triggered the scan but extracted nothing). CVE alerting on actions remains via Renovate / Dependabot vulnerability alerts, which is a separate pipeline from OSV-Scanner and operates correctly.

GitHub Actions bumps stay manual until the `Workflow Lint Gate` is tightened from advisory to required (#542). At that point the row above moves to **SAFE (patch+minor)**.

### Auto-merge eligibility tiers

| Tier | Definition | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| **A -- always auto-merge** | Digest pins and lockfile maintenance. Behavior change is bounded by what already passed the full required-check suite. | Docker base image digest; `lockFileMaintenance` |
| **B -- auto-merge patch+minor** | Categories marked SAFE in the coverage table above. | All Python, web framework + UI + build, sidecar runtime + dev, mobile, vendored docs. GitHub Actions are tier-D-pending until #542 tightens the Workflow Lint Gate. |
| **C -- manual on minor** | Categories where minor bumps warrant human eyes. Patches still auto-merge. | Web markdown renderers (`react-markdown`, `remark-gfm`) |
| **D -- always manual** | Major bumps, categories with documented coverage gaps, K8s manifests, and any category not represented in the coverage table above. | All `major` updates; mobile crypto (until SQLCipher round-trip test lands); K8s/Kustomize files; new ecosystems |

### How this contract is enforced

The enforcement chain has five steps. All steps must succeed for an auto-merge to fire; failure at any step means the PR sits for human review.

1. **Renovate sets the label.** `.github/renovate.json5` package rules add (or do not add) the `automerge` label to each PR based on the dep category and update type. Tier C/D categories never receive the label; Tier A/B do.
2. **The auto-merge workflow's `if:` filter.** `.github/workflows/auto-merge-renovate.yml` triggers on `pull_request: [opened, reopened, synchronize]` and runs the merge job ONLY when (a) the PR author is `glycemicgpt-renovate[bot]`, (b) the PR carries the `automerge` label, and (c) the PR targets `develop`. Bot-author check prevents impersonation; `labeled` event is intentionally NOT triggered so triage-permission users cannot bypass the gate by labeling a non-Renovate PR.
3. **File-scope guard.** Before invoking the merge, the workflow checks that the PR only touches files in a hardcoded allowlist (lockfiles, manifests, Dockerfiles, workflow `uses:` pins, Renovate's own config). Any file outside the allowlist aborts the auto-merge.
4. **The merge bot calls `gh pr merge --auto --squash`.** The workflow mints a token from a dedicated GitHub App and uses it for the merge call. The merge bot is configured to bypass the CODEOWNERS approval requirement on develop's ruleset.
5. **Required status checks gate the merge.** `--auto` queues the merge; GitHub waits for all required checks to pass before processing. Bypass-actor status only skips the CODEOWNERS approval requirement, not the required checks. If any required gate fails, the merge does not fire and the PR sits with auto-merge "armed" until checks pass (or someone manually closes it).

Default-deny: a PR without the `automerge` label sits until a human reviews it.

**Status: operational on develop as of PR #547.**

### When to update this section

Update the coverage table whenever any of the following occur:

- A new Renovate-managed ecosystem is added (e.g., new lockfile, new manager). Add a corresponding row to the coverage table BEFORE enabling auto-merge for that category.
- A new auth pattern is added (OAuth provider, API key flow, webhook signing). Update the relevant row's **Tests That Fire** column to reference the new test in `scripts/security/test-auth-flows.py`.
- A required status check is added or removed from develop's branch protection. Audit each row to confirm its **Tests That Fire** still resolves to a required check.
- A deploy example begins exposing a previously-internal service (e.g., the sidecar). Re-evaluate that service's row under the threat model.
- A `packageRule` or `groupName` is added or changed in `.github/renovate.json5`. New groups change which deps are bundled into a single PR, which changes which tests fire on which PRs -- audit affected rows.
- A new entry is added to `osv-scanner.toml` `IgnoredVulns`. An active suppression on a package in any auto-merge-eligible row weakens that row's coverage; weigh whether the row should be downgraded to manual until the suppression is reviewed.
- Quarterly review: re-walk the table to catch drift.

`lockFileMaintenance` PRs (run weekly Monday mornings via Renovate) bump every transitive dep simultaneously across `apps/api/uv.lock`, `apps/web/package-lock.json`, and `sidecar/package-lock.json`. They are auto-merge eligible (Tier A) because they touch the path filters of the rows they affect, so the same tests fire as for any other change to those manifests. The OSV-Scanner cron (`dependency-scan.yml`, Monday 6am UTC) runs alongside; verify these stay aligned if either schedule moves.

The table is the contract. If it does not match reality, fix the table or fix reality -- never let them diverge silently.

## Adding Security Tests for New Integrations

### New API endpoints

**Auto-covered.** The API fuzzer, IDOR tests, and ZAP scan all read `/openapi.json` at runtime. New FastAPI routes with proper type hints are automatically tested. No manual changes needed.

### New web pages

**Auto-covered (full suite).** The ZAP web scan pre-seeds known URLs and uses AJAX Spider to discover new routes. If you add a new page to `apps/web/src/app/`, add its URL to `scripts/security/zap-web-plan.yaml` in the requestor section for guaranteed coverage.

### New auth patterns (OAuth, API keys, webhooks)

**Manual.** Add tests to `scripts/security/test-auth-flows.py`.

### New dependencies

**Manual.** If you add a new ecosystem or lockfile:

1. Add the lockfile path to the `scan` step in `.github/workflows/dependency-scan.yml`.
2. Add the lockfile path to the `detect-changes` filter in the same workflow.
3. Verify the scan runs on the next PR.
4. Add a row to the **Dependency Auto-Merge Coverage** table above describing what tests fire when the new dep category changes. Until the row exists, Renovate updates for the new ecosystem stay manual (default-deny).

Pump-driver plugin code now lives in [`lumose-health/android-unofficial`](https://github.com/lumose-health/android-unofficial) alongside the Android app -- see that repo's `docs/dev/security-testing.md` for its plugin and mobile security coverage.

## Running Locally
