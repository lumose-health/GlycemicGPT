# GlycemicGPT Local Dev Server Testing Checklist

## Prerequisites

1. **Docker and Docker Compose** installed
2. **Node.js 20+** and npm installed
3. **Python 3.12+** and uv package manager installed (for backend dev)
4. **Ports available:** 5432 (PostgreSQL), 6379 (Redis), 8000 (API), 3000 (Web)

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Start backend services (database, redis, API)
docker compose up -d db redis
cd apps/api && uv run alembic upgrade head && uv run uvicorn src.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

# 2. Start frontend (in a separate terminal)
cd apps/web && npm run dev

# 3. Run automated smoke test (in a separate terminal)
./scripts/smoke-test.sh
```

Alternatively, start everything via Docker:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

## Automated Tests

### Backend Unit Tests (pytest)

```bash
cd apps/api
DATABASE_URL="postgresql+asyncpg://glycemicgpt:glycemicgpt@localhost:5432/glycemicgpt_test" \
TESTING=true \
uv run pytest --tb=short -q
```

- 42 test files, 200+ test cases
- Covers auth, RBAC, integrations, AI, alerts, telegram, caregivers, settings

### Frontend Unit Tests (Jest)

```bash
cd apps/web
npm test
```

- 20+ test suites, 480+ test cases
- Covers all pages, settings, sidebar, briefs, AI chat

### API Smoke Test

```bash
./scripts/smoke-test.sh
```

- Automated end-to-end check of all API endpoints
- Registers a test user, logs in, exercises all settings/features, logs out
- Verifies health probes, auth flow, settings CRUD, integrations, AI, caregivers

## Troubleshooting

### API won't start
- Check PostgreSQL is running: `docker compose ps db`
- Check Redis is running: `docker compose ps redis`
- Verify DATABASE_URL environment variable
- Run migrations: `cd apps/api && uv run alembic upgrade head`

### Frontend shows "Failed to fetch" everywhere
- Backend API must be running on port 8000
- Check that the web container can reach the API (API_URL env var, default http://api:8000)
- Browser requests are proxied through the web server via Next.js rewrites -- no direct API access needed

### Tests fail with database errors
- Ensure a test database exists
- Set TESTING=true environment variable
- Run migrations on the test database first

### Settings Save button stays disabled
- This was fixed in a previous release
- If it persists, check browser console for API errors
- Verify the backend endpoint returns expected schema
