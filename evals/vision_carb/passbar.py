"""The local-model vision pass-bar: turn the prose spec into enforced code.

``FINDINGS.md`` describes, in prose, the bar a *local* vision model must clear to
be considered good enough for food carbohydrate estimation. This module is the
single, executable source of truth for that bar; a unit test
(``test_findings_table_matches_passbar_constants``) pins the FINDINGS.md threshold
table to these constants, so the doc and the gate stay in sync rather than drift.

The bar leads with **reproducibility and identity**, not average accuracy. The
research the harness operationalizes (see ``FINDINGS.md``) found that a model
which is accurate *on average* but swings wildly photo-to-photo, or that
confidently misidentifies a simple food, is the one that causes acute harm:
run-to-run variance is the acute-hypo risk, and food misidentification is
upstream of -- and dominates -- carb error. So MAE is a floor, not the headline;
a model fails on variance or identity even with a good average.

Two design rules make this safe to gate on:

  * **Fail-closed.** A criterion whose metric could not be measured (no usable
    samples, no ground-truth identity, fewer than two samples for CV) is treated
    as *not passed*, never as "passed by default". A benchmark that cannot prove
    a safety property has not cleared the bar.
  * **N >= 5 to certify.** ``FINDINGS.md`` shows the per-item CV estimate at N=3
    is noisy and *optimistic* (it understates dispersion on average), so a model
    must not be certified on N=3's flattering variance. Below the certification N
    the verdict is ``INSUFFICIENT_DATA`` (not ``PASS``) -- the run is informative
    but does not certify the model.

The thresholds are *easy-set* gates: a simple, single food is where a model has
no excuse, so the bar is set there. The adversarial set is reported and compared
to the cloud reference for guidance, but is not a hard absolute gate (look-alikes
are hard for every model). Nothing here is a dosing output; the pass-bar gates a
*model*, never a meal.
