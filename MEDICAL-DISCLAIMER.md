## Regulatory Status

This software has **not** been cleared, approved, or certified by any regulatory authority worldwide, including but not limited to:

- The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
- EU Notified Bodies (no CE marking under MDR 2017/745)
- Health Canada
- Australia's Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA)
- Any equivalent national regulatory authority

## Not a Medical Device

**This software is NOT a medical device.** It is experimental open-source software provided for educational and informational purposes only. No individual, organization, or entity associated with this project is the "manufacturer" of a medical device under any regulatory framework.

GlycemicGPT does not control any medical devices. It reads data from insulin pumps and continuous glucose monitors (CGMs), displays that data, and provides AI-generated text suggestions. These suggestions are not medical advice and must not be treated as such.

## Health Data Processing

This software processes health data including:

- Continuous glucose monitor (CGM) readings
- Insulin pump telemetry (basal rates, bolus history, insulin on board)
- Pump hardware status (battery, reservoir levels)
- User-configured therapy parameters (target glucose ranges, insulin ratios)

Users are responsible for understanding the privacy and security implications of their deployment. The self-hosted GlycemicGPT platform stores user data on infrastructure the user controls. **However, whether health data leaves that infrastructure depends on which AI provider the user configures**, and is not determined by the platform itself.

When using the BYOAI (Bring Your Own AI) feature:

- **Cloud-hosted AI providers** (any AI service that processes requests on third-party servers, including hosted APIs, subscription products, and AI router or gateway services that forward traffic to upstream cloud models) receive the user's glucose, insulin, pump, and therapy data context for inference. That data is then subject to the provider's data-handling policy and the policies of any upstream providers it routes to.
- **Local AI providers** (models running on infrastructure the user controls -- e.g., Ollama, vLLM, or llama.cpp on the user's own hardware or network) keep that data on the user's network.

It is the user's responsibility to verify where their configured AI endpoint routes traffic and to review the data-handling policy of any provider that will receive their health data before configuring it. The GlycemicGPT platform does not proxy or intercept AI requests on behalf of users.

## AI Limitations

AI-generated suggestions in this software are produced by large language models (LLMs) that are known to:

- **Hallucinate** -- generate plausible-sounding but incorrect information
- **Misinterpret data** -- draw incorrect conclusions from glucose readings
- **Provide outdated information** -- not reflect the latest medical guidelines
- **Lack context** -- not understand your complete medical history, comorbidities, or current medications

All AI-generated content in this software is labeled as suggestions, not medical advice. Never act on AI suggestions without consulting your healthcare team.

## Critical Warnings

1. **Do not replace professional medical care.** Always consult with your endocrinologist, diabetes educator, or healthcare provider before making any changes to your diabetes management.

2. **Verify all suggestions.** Any insulin dosing, carb ratio, or correction factor suggestions must be verified with your healthcare team before use.

3. **Use extreme caution.** Incorrect diabetes management can result in severe hypoglycemia, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), or other life-threatening conditions.

4. **If you experience a diabetes emergency, contact your healthcare provider or emergency services immediately.** Do not rely on this software for emergency medical guidance.

## Project-Owned Unofficial Builds and Third-Party Forks

GlycemicGPT is a monitoring and analysis platform across all builds it ships. The plugin SDK is read-only by design and is published in two contexts:

1. **Official builds** -- Docker images, web app, and the App Store / Google Play mobile apps. These do not load custom plugins at runtime.
2. **Project-owned unofficial builds** -- planned sideloaded Android and iOS apps (see [roadmap](https://glycemicgpt.org/docs/about/roadmap) §Phase 3) that include the read-only plugin SDK so users can extend the platform with additional **device data drivers**. The project does not ship, document, or solicit any plugin that controls insulin delivery or modifies pump settings; the SDK has no insulin delivery primitives (no bolus dosing, no basal rate changes, no therapeutic write surface). The same monitoring-only stance applies to project-owned unofficial builds as to official builds.

**Third-party forks are a separate matter.** Forks of this project that modify the SDK to add device control, insulin delivery, or any other pump-write functionality operate **outside the GlycemicGPT project**. The maintainers do not review them, recommend them, accept liability for them, or accept contributions to this repository whose intent is to enable them.

Users who choose to build, install, or run a third-party fork that introduces device control become the **manufacturer of their personal medical device** and accept full responsibility for that decision. This follows the same legal posture used by DIY diabetes projects such as Loop and AndroidAPS -- independent, community-built systems whose users have long operated as the manufacturers of their own personal medical devices.

## Untested Device Compatibility

This software may declare protocol compatibility with devices that have **not been tested against physical hardware**. Protocol compatibility (shared BLE protocol, authentication mechanism, and data formats) does not guarantee correct operation. Specifically:

- Data displayed from untested devices may be inaccurate, delayed, or missing
- BLE connection behavior, reconnection stability, and pairing flows may differ
- Safety-critical values (insulin on board, glucose readings, basal rates) must always be verified against the device manufacturer's official companion app
- Users who choose to use this software with untested device hardware accept all associated risk

No contributor, maintainer, or entity associated with this project is liable for any adverse outcome resulting from use with untested or partially-tested device hardware. If in doubt, use only the device manufacturer's official software.

THIS INCLUDES BUT IS NOT LIMITED TO ANY DAMAGES, INJURIES, OR ADVERSE HEALTH OUTCOMES RESULTING FROM THE USE OF THIS SOFTWARE. BY USING GLYCEMICGPT, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT:

- You are using this software entirely at your own risk
- You will not rely solely on AI-generated suggestions for medical decisions
- You understand that AI can and will make errors
- You will maintain regular care with qualified healthcare professionals
- You accept full responsibility for any decisions made based on this software's output
- No individual or entity associated with this project is liable for medical outcomes

## License Warranty Disclaimer

This software is licensed under the GNU General Public License v3.0 (GPL-3.0). Per Sections 15-17 of the GPL-3.0:

- **Section 15:** THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.
- **Section 16:** IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES.
- **Section 17:** If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program.

See the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for the complete GPL-3.0 text.

**Jurisdictional note:** Limitation of liability clauses for personal injury may be unenforceable in some jurisdictions, including under EU consumer protection law, UK consumer rights legislation, and Australian consumer law. The primary risk mitigation strategy of this project is its monitoring-only design -- shipped builds do not provide device control or insulin delivery capability. Users who run forks of this project that add such capabilities operate under a build-from-source model where the individual user becomes the "manufacturer" of their personal build, consistent with the precedent set by Loop, AndroidAPS, and other DIY diabetes projects. This disclaimer does not constitute legal advice.
