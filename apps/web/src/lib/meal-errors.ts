/**
 * Map a food-records API failure to a user-facing UX state.

 * Mirrors the mobile client's detail-substring contract (MealRepository.mapError)

 * unavailable / feature-off response is a non-retryable "dead end" that points
 * the user at Settings, while transient failures are retryable. None of these
 * strings are carb/nutrition descriptive copy -- they steer the user away from
