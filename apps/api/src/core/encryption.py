"""Story 3.1 / 28.1 / 28.5: Credential encryption utilities.

Provides symmetric encryption for storing third-party API credentials securely.
Uses Fernet (AES-128-CBC with HMAC) from the cryptography library.

Story 28.1: Uses a separate ENCRYPTION_KEY when available, falling back to secret_key.
Story 28.5: Uses PBKDF2 for key derivation (600K iterations) instead of raw SHA-256.
            Backward-compatible: tries PBKDF2 first, falls back to legacy SHA-256 derivation,
            and re-encrypts with PBKDF2 on successful legacy decryption.
