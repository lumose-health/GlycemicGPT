"""Meal-photo carb estimation pipeline.

Ties the pieces together: validate + store the photo, ask the user's configured
AI provider to describe its carbohydrate content via the sidecar's vision route,
parse the structured estimate against the shared contract, enforce the
reject-not-clamp carb bounds, and persist a ``food_records`` row.

Routing note (the provider-call path): all vision traffic goes through the AI
sidecar's OpenAI-compatible ``/v1/chat/completions`` endpoint. The sidecar is
the sole sanctioned home for vision: it centralizes every provider mechanism
(Anthropic API-key Messages API, Claude/ChatGPT subscription CLIs) along with
the SSRF/sandbox hardening, and selects the mechanism from the *model name*
we send (which is derived from the user's active provider). This differs from
the text path, where direct-API-key providers call their SDK directly -- but the
sidecar is the only place vision is sanctioned to run. When no provider has a
configured vision mechanism the sidecar returns HTTP 422 ``vision_unavailable``,
which we surface as a clear error rather than a silent failure or a fabricated
estimate.

Safety: this module produces a descriptive food estimate (carb range +
confidence + nutrition) and nothing else. It never returns or computes a dose,
and the persisted record is never read by IoB / treatment_safety / carb-ratio
math.
