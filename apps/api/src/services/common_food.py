"""Correction loop + common-food promotion service.

This is the truth-correction and personalization layer on top of the meal-photo
estimation pipeline:

  * ``correct_food_record`` applies a user's carb/nutrition correction to a
    record -- writing the ``corrected_*`` seams, flipping provenance to
    ``USER_CORRECTED``, and preserving the original AI estimate.
  * ``confirm_food_identity`` confirms/corrects *what the food is* (Story 50.H2),
    then -- and only then -- runs external grounding (USDA / Open Food Facts)
    against the confirmed identity. This is the one function here that performs an
    outbound nutrition lookup.
  * ``promote_to_common_food`` saves a record's (corrected, else AI) values as a
    user-named, deduped baseline and links the record to it.
  * ``link_record_to_common_food`` / ``update_common_food`` handle explicit
    linking and baseline edits.

Safety posture (NON-NEGOTIABLE): a correction or an identity confirmation fixes a
*description of the food*, never a dose. Nothing here returns or computes insulin,
and neither corrected records, confirmed identities, nor common foods are ever
read by IoB / treatment_safety / carb-ratio math. All work is scoped to the
authenticated owner by the caller.
