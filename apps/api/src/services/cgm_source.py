"""Cross-source CGM roles + primary-source resolution (Story 43.10).

A user can have more than one CGM-providing integration feeding
``glucose_readings`` -- e.g. Dexcom Share AND a Loop-via-Nightscout
connection that reads the same Dexcom sensor and reposts it. Without a
preference the same physical reading lands twice (different ``source``
strings) and doubles AGP / TIR / CGM-summary.

Each CGM source carries a ``cgm_role`` (``primary`` / ``secondary`` /
``off``) on its own row -- on ``IntegrationCredential`` for Dexcom and on
``NightscoutConnection`` for a Nightscout connection. The glucose read
endpoints exclude ``secondary`` / ``off`` source strings by default
(``?include_secondary=true`` re-includes ``secondary``), so only the
primary source drives widgets while the others stay queryable for audit.

A source is identified everywhere by its ``glucose_readings.source``
string: ``"dexcom"`` for the Dexcom integration and
``"nightscout:<connection_id>"`` for a Nightscout connection.

Scope: this story covers Dexcom + Nightscout (the two CGM feeds named in
the story). Other CGM-writing integrations added later (Glooko cloud,
Medtronic Connect) keep their own state tables without a ``cgm_role`` and
are therefore not yet role-managed -- their readings are additive, never
hidden. Extending dedupe to them is a follow-up (needs a ``cgm_role`` on
those tables + picker entries).
