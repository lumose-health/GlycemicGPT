"""Map Nightscout devicestatus records to ForecastSnapshot rows.

Story 43.12 PR 2. Extends the devicestatus translator to write a
`forecast_snapshots` row each time a payload carries a closed-loop
forecast (Loop's `loop.predicted.values[]` or AAPS / Trio / oref0 /
iAPS's `openaps.suggested.predBGs.*`).

Design rules (from `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/story-43.12-forecast-overlay-design.md`):

1. **Tolerate missing curves.** AAPS may post only IOB, or any subset
   of (IOB, COB, UAM, ZT). Loop posts a single curve.
2. **Source attribution preserved.** `source_engine` (`'loop'` /
   `'aaps'` / `'trio'` / `'oref0'` / `'iaps'`) drives the AI context
   and chart legend. Reuse the existing `detect_uploader()` heuristic
   from `models.py` rather than re-implement.
3. **Skip silently on indeterminate / malformed payloads.** Return
   `None`; the translator counts that as a skip. No exceptions cross
   the mapper boundary so a buggy uploader never blocks the
   devicestatus-snapshot insert path.
4. **Idempotent via dedupe_key = NS `_id`.** Same devicestatus arriving
   in two sync cycles UPSERTs the same forecast row.

What the AI sees later (PR 5): each row carries `issued_at`,
`source_engine`, and the `default_curve_name` so the context builder
can label honestly: "your Loop predicts...", not "your glucose is..."
