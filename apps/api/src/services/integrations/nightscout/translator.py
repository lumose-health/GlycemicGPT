"""Nightscout translator -- orchestrates input parsing + ORM upserts.

Public entry points:
- `translate_entries()` -- list of raw entry dicts -> count of glucose
  reading rows upserted
- `translate_treatments()` -- list of raw treatment dicts -> counts of
  glucose-reading + pump-event rows upserted
- `translate_devicestatuses()` -- list of raw devicestatus dicts ->
  count of snapshot rows upserted
- `translate_profile()` -- raw profile dict -> True/False (snapshot
  upserted, or skipped because the profile has no active store)

All four entry points:
1. Validate input via the Pydantic input models (PR1's parsers)
2. Route via per-target mappers (per-mapper module under this package)
3. Issue PostgreSQL `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` upserts via
   the connection's user_id and a per-target dedupe key

Source attribution: every persisted row carries
`source = "nightscout:<connection_id>"` at the table level. Sub-
attribution (uploader, raw device string, raw enteredBy string) lives
in `metadata_json` for pump_events; for glucose_readings we rely on
the table-level `source` column alone (uploader sub-attribution is
recoverable by joining back to the connection's recent treatments if
needed).

Conflict resolution semantics:

- Same source, same `ns_id`: re-fetch is a no-op (per-source partial
  unique index dedupes).
- Cross-source on glucose_readings (`user_id`, `reading_timestamp`):
  ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING keeps whichever was inserted first. Direct
  integrations (Tandem cloud, etc.) typically write before the
  Nightscout sync runs, so in practice they win the race -- but this
  is **first-writer-wins, not enforced priority**. A Nightscout-only
  user gets Nightscout-attributed rows; a user with both has whichever
  source ran first per timestamp.
- Cross-source on pump_events: the pre-existing
  `(user_id, event_timestamp, event_type)` unique index now applies
  only WHERE `ns_id IS NULL` (i.e. to direct-integration rows).
  Nightscout-sourced rows dedupe via the partial unique index on
  `(source, ns_id) WHERE ns_id IS NOT NULL`. This avoids the bug where
  two AAPS SMBs at the same second would silently drop one.

`received_at` is set on insert and is **not** updated on conflict --
think of it as `first_received_at`. There is currently no
`last_observed_at` column; if a downstream consumer needs to know when
we last re-saw a record, that's a follow-up.

Soft-delete propagation is **not yet implemented**: when an upstream
record is soft-deleted (`isValid: false`) on Nightscout, the input
model returns `semantic_kind == "unknown"` and the translator drops
the record on the parse side. A pre-existing row in our DB with the
same `ns_id` is left in place. Tracked as a known limitation; needs
either an `is_retracted` column or DELETE-on-soft-delete logic.

    correlating, the dashboard's `Recent Boluses` table (which reads
    `iob_at_event` / `cob_at_event` / `bg_at_event` directly off the
    pump_event row) renders those columns as `---` for every NS-
    sourced bolus.

    Bounded by:
    - `source` -- only this NS connection's rows
    - `cutoff` -- caller-supplied lower bound (usually 14 days ago);
      old historical boluses don't get retroactive context updates.
    - 15-minute snapshot window -- if no devicestatus was posted
      within 15 min before the bolus we can't reasonably correlate
      and `iob_at_event` stays NULL (the table cell renders `---`).

    Runs after `_upsert_devicestatus_snapshots` so the just-inserted
    snapshots are visible to the join. Should be called inside the
    pump-events SAVEPOINT so a failure here doesn't poison the
    snapshot insert.

    Returns the number of rows updated.

    DO NOTHING (not DO UPDATE) is the current conservative choice: we
    treat a forecast as immutable once issued. If an upstream uploader
    (e.g., AAPS V3's edit-and-re-upload flow) rewrites a devicestatus
    body in-place, our row keeps the original contents. This trade-off
    favors stable provenance (deferred scoring job sees the original
    forecast that was actually live at issue time) over freshness.
    Revisit if production shows real same-key churn -- the deferred
    `forecast_evaluations` scoring job would benefit from observability
    on such cases.

    `received_at` is set in the mapper at row-build time. On dedupe
    skip, the new `received_at` value is lost (the original row's
    value remains). Acceptable trade-off; would matter only if a
