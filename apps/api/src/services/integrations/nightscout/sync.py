"""Per-connection Nightscout sync.

Drives the four translator entry points against a single
`NightscoutConnection`. Used by:

- The manual `POST /api/integrations/nightscout/{id}/sync` endpoint
  (Story 43.4 AC10) so a user can pull "now" from the UI.
- The Story 43.4 background scheduler (`run_nightscout_sync_all_users`)
  which calls this once per due connection on each tick.

`since` semantics:
- First sync (no cursor yet): default backfill window from
  `initial_sync_window_days` (0 = unbounded for entries/treatments;
  always capped at 30 days for devicestatus to bound blast radius).
- Subsequent syncs (entries): `last_entry_object_id` -- NS's Mongo
  `_id` from the last response. Mongo ObjectId is monotonic by
  insertion time, so this catches entries that uploaders backfilled
  into NS with `dateString` values from before our last sync
  (Dexcom Share -> NS bridge is the most common offender; issue #598).
- Subsequent syncs (treatments / devicestatus): `last_synced_at` --
  these endpoints already query by NS server-side `created_at`, which
  is monotonic by insertion time, so they're immune to the late-upload
  class of bug that hit entries.

Cursor advancement: only on full success (all four translate calls
returned without raising). On any partial failure the status / error
are recorded but the cursor stays put so the next run re-fetches the
same window. Documented + tested in `test_sync.py`.

Exception mapping:
- NightscoutAuthError              -> AUTH_FAILED
- NightscoutRateLimitError         -> RATE_LIMITED
- NightscoutNetworkError           -> NETWORK
- NightscoutValidationError / etc. -> ERROR
