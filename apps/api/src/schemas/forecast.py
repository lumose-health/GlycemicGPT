"""Pydantic schemas for the forecast read endpoint (Story 43.12 PR 3).

Shape consumers (in order they'll land):

- PR 4: frontend forecast-overlay picker reads `available_sources` to
  populate the dropdown; reads `forecast.curves_mgdl` +
  `default_curve_name` to draw the dotted line.
- PR 5: AI context builder reads `forecast.source_engine` and the
  default curve to talk honestly ("your Loop predicts..." not "your
  glucose is...").
- Mobile (eventual): same shape, no client-side adjustment.

`state`/`source`-style Literal types match the backend Pydantic
contract for PR 6's `LoopStatusResponse` so the frontend can mirror
the same union types end-to-end.

      24h "is this source online" window, NOT the 30-min freshness
      window. An engine can be `available` (in the dropdown) but
      have its latest snapshot too stale to render -- the frontend
      surfaces that via the `stale` reason.
