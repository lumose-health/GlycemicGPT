"""Food-record API: meal-photo carb estimation.

Upload a meal photo, get a structured carbohydrate estimate (range + confidence
+ nutrition), and persist it as a food record. The feature is gated by the
user's own ``meal_intelligence_enabled`` preference.

Safety: every response describes food, never a dose. No endpoint here returns or
computes insulin/dosing, and food records are never fed into IoB /
treatment_safety / carb-ratio math.
